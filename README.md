## Spring 2021 Web Development Challenge - Maze Generator

This is the tenth and final project in my [Spring 2021 - Web Development Challenge](https://10in30.alexander-morse.com/) series, where I am attempting to design, code, and ship ten different web projects in the space of one month, under a variety of constraints.

This last project is a maze-generation proof-of-concept, primarily demonstrating use of the Canvas API.

A live version of this project can be found running [here](https://arm-ac-maze.surge.sh/).

What you see is what you get with this one - it's ugly, barely functional, and flatly doesn't work on mobile devices. But in a way, it sort of epitomizes everything I've been through this month. This "game" is quite simple, provided one is on a device that can play it. A maze will generate, and the player should click-and-drag the ball to the goal. Then a new maze will generate - rinse and repeat. While there are a number of obvious shortcomings, the one I feel the most is the lack of playability on mobile devices. While that would definitely be a critical flaw in a real project, figuring out how to make it possible here would have taken me over the deadline.

On a more positive note, I was able to successfully do what I failed to do in Project #3: build my own development environment for a non-trivial web application. As usual for this challenge, I by no means did it *well*, but I was able to make Rollup.js continuously build my Javascript as I was writing it. If there's one thing I'm taking away from this month, it's a newfound respect for the work that goes into understanding and implementing these setups, and I'm looking forward to learning how to build them right.

All that's left for this challenge is some clean-up work and a few closing remarks.
